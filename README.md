# 🚀 Langchain RAG Model: Your AI-Powered Question Answering System


## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the Langchain RAG Model project! This cutting-edge system combines the power of large language models with precise information retrieval to create a smart, context-aware question answering tool. Whether you're a data scientist, AI enthusiast, or just curious about the latest in AI technology, this project has something exciting for you!

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 Utilizes state-of-the-art language models
- 🌐 Ingests and processes web content dynamically
- 🔍 Efficient information retrieval using FAISS vector database
- 💡 Generates accurate and contextual responses
- 🎨 Provides creative outputs like related poems
- 🔄 Suggests intelligent follow-up questions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: The core programming language
- **Langchain**: For building the RAG pipeline
- **OpenAI's GPT Models**: Powering our language understanding and generation
- **FAISS**: For efficient vector similarity search
- **BeautifulSoup**: Web scraping and content processing
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and demonstration

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   gh repo clone GanapathySubramaniam/LANGCHAIN_OVERVIEW
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API keys**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. **Open `langchain_rag_model.ipynb` and start exploring!**

## 📘 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: The system loads content from specified web URLs.
2. **Text Processing**: Loaded content is split into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding Creation**: Text chunks are converted into numerical embeddings.
4. **Vector Database**: Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database for quick retrieval.
5. **Query Processing**: User queries are processed and relevant information is retrieved.
6. **Response Generation**: The language model generates responses based on the retrieved context and user query.

## 🌈 Use Cases

- 📚 Educational tools for quick, accurate information retrieval
- 💼 Business intelligence systems for context-aware data analysis
- 🎭 Creative writing assistants with factual grounding
- 🔬 Research aids for literature review and hypothesis generation
